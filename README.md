# 📰 Extractive Text Summarization

This project implements **Extractive Text Summarization**, a technique used to generate concise summaries by selecting key sentences from the original text. Unlike abstractive methods, extractive summarization does not generate new sentences—it selects existing ones that best capture the main ideas.
